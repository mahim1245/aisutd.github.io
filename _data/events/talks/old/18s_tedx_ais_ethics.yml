description: "Join us for a discussion led by <a href='https://www.utdallas.edu/~ngans/' target='_blank'>Dr. Nicholas Gans</a> and <a href='https://www.utdallas.edu/ah/people/faculty_detail.php?faculty_id=101' target='_blank'>Dr. Matthew Brown</a> about different viewpoints behind the world of AI and the ethics around it. Modern-day technology is progressing at an ever-increasing rate and different perspectives inevitably clash in the endeavor to advance the field of AI; it is imperative that we as a society take the time to consider the ethics of such progress to ensure we advance our technologies with the right intentions."
