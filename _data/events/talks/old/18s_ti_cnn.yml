description: Ever wondered how self-driving cars or computer vision works? Join us for an AI talk about convolutional neural networks given by Arthur J. Redfern, machine learning lab manager at Texas Instruments! Free pizza will be provided as usual!<br/><br/>Arthur J. Redfern received a B.S. in 1995 from the University of Virginia and a M.S. and Ph.D. in 1996 and 1999, respectively, from the Georgia Institute of Technology, all in electrical engineering.  Following his thesis work on nonlinear systems modeled by the Volterra series, Arthur joined Texas Instruments where he currently manages the Machine Learning Lab.  His activities at TI have spanned the areas of machine learning (convolutional neural network based automotive and industrial applications, software libraries and hardware design), high performance computing (software libraries), signal processing for analog systems (ADCs, amplifiers, DACs, design optimization, speakers and touch screens) and communication system design (DSL, DTV and SerDes).  He has over 20 papers published in refereed conferences and journals and has been granted over 20 US patents.
