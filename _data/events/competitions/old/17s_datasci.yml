DataSci is an online competition aiming to support student-created data science projects. The competition will be open to all university students globally, and will involve the following topics: creating unique algorithms for analyzing data, visualizations, write-ups on derived insights, and more. Up to $4000 are available in prizes in four different submission categories.

Participants will work together in small teams to find undiscovered patterns and new meanings in datasets of their choice. General guidelines will be provided, but DataSci will primarily be about engaging both the creativity and learning capacity of its participants.
