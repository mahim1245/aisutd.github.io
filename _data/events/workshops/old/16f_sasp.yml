             </br></br>Come participate in the 'common sense reasoning with answer set programming' workshops by Dr. Gopal Gupta! 
             We are offering two workshops with different content to provide a solid knowledge foundation for our upcoming hackathon, HackAI. 
             And yes, there will be pizza!

             </br></br>Answer set programming (ASP) is a rule-based paradigm for programming intelligent applications that involve common 
             sense reasoning. ASP allows simulation of reasoning techniques that humans employ on a daily basis---default reasoning, 
             counterfactual reasoning, abductive reasoning, etc. Thus, very powerful reasoning applications can be built with ASP such 
             as&#58 web-based recommendation systems, undergraduate degree audit and advising, disease management, representing high school 
             biology knowledge, etc. We will be using the s(ASP) system, an implementation of ASP developed at UT Dallas.
